# short-term-education
Using this as a tracker for things I plan on learning over the next few __. I want to fill self-perceived gaps in my education, with a strong orientation towards actionable learnings. I'll bias away from gen-ed, but it will still be sprinked in their. 

This is totally fucking random. How did you find this? Why are you still reading? I have 0 credentials, and this series is hyper-personalized to me. You gain literally nothing from being here. Unless you think I should do things differently. In which case, talk ya shit and put out a PR.

| Typescript| [The Docs, Work is changing to TS this week lol gotta learn that shiz](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html), [Also, this](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/)| ✔️ | 11/22/21 | I read through the docs and did a little bit of a project (in this repo) to get used to working with it. Since I'll learn more using it at work, I wanted this cut this one short and move on. |
| Spanish | [4 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE-03EATjho) | ✔️ | 11/14/21 | Honestly just hella fun. English is the language of the trade but I always wanted to learn spanish. I never said my education was limited to CS _only_, though, it is the bulk of it :) Goal here is to get a refresher after 4 years of HS spanish, and then start conversing more regularly. I chose this video because there is a 3 hour listening skills section. Before beginning, I knew enough spanish to communicate almost any idea I needed to (albeit, very broken with poor grammar), but can't converse when others are speaking muy rapido. |

To Assign - For one reason or another, I want to get to these resources (maybe for work, maybe for fun). This board will change. I'd probably kick the math stuff off for a few of these. We'll see.
