# short-term-education
Using this as a tracker for things I plan on learning over the next few __. I want to fill self-perceived gaps in my education, with a strong orientation towards actionable learnings. I'll bias away from gen-ed, but it will still be sprinked in their. 

This is totally fucking random. How did you find this? Why are you still reading? I have 0 credentials, and this series is hyper-personalized to me. You gain literally nothing from being here. Unless you think I should do things differently. In which case, talk ya shit and put out a PR.
